- I noticed the mock up spec had "Special Needs, Bonded Pair" for Bridget, but I couldn't find anything other than a boolean for special needs so I just put "Special Needs" or nothing.
- I noticed on "Pet Card Styling", 'S' was the only card that didn't include city and state under gender and age...wasn't sure if this was intentional or not.
- The age of the animals is in yrs on the mock ups, but age that comes back is 'young' or 'adult'
